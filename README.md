### DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION
1. Data loading

### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)
Use pivot tables and calculated columns where necessary to answer the following:
1. What is the average discount percentage by product category?
2. How many products are listed under each category?
3. What is the total number of reviews per category?
4. Which products have the highest average ratings?
5. What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category?
6. Which products have the highest number of reviews?
7. How many products have a discount of 50% or more?
8. What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0,
4.0, etc.)?
9. What is the total potential revenue (actual price Ã— rating count) by category?
10. What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <$200,
F200-5500, >7500)?
11. How does the rating relate to the level of discount?
12. How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?
13. Which categories have products with the highest discounts?
14. Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined.
